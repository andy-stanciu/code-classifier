         * Base Cases:
         * - If n is 1, it returns true, which is correct because 1 is a happy number.
         * - If n is 4, it returns false, which is used to detect the start of a cycle
         * but is not a comprehensive check.
         *
         * Digit Squaring:
         * - The code calculates the sum of the squares of the digits of n using a while
         * loop.
         * - This is a correct step for finding the next number in the sequence.
         *
         * Recursion:
         * - The method then calls itself recursively with the sum of the squares.
         * - This approach will not work correctly because it does not check for cycles,
         * potentially leading to infinite recursion.
