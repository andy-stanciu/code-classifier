        // 1. You can do this by using two loops and finding count of each element and comparing with the whole array but it takes O(n^2) time.
        // 2. You can use HashMap for finding maximum frequency and returning the element but it takes O(n) space.
        // 3. Best approach is to use maximumVote-Algorithm(Boyer\'s Moore Voting Algorithm) which count with its current element in O(N) time and O(1)space.
